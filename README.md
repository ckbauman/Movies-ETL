# Movies-ETL
Module 8

## Overview
Amazing Prime is running a hackathon on movie data.  Provide data from 3 sources that the hackers can use. Then import the data into a database.

## Results

The following are sources of data:
- movies_metadata.csv    (kaggle_file)
- ratings.csv      (ratings_file)
- wikipedia-movies.json   (wiki_file)

The following Jupyter Notebook files were created to pull the data: 
- Deliverable 1: ETL_function_test.ipynb
- Deliverable 2: ETL_clean_wiki_movies.ipynb
- Deliverable 3: ETL_clean_kaggle_data.ipynb
- Deliverable 4. ETL_create_database.ipynb

The following tables were created in postgreSQL pgAdmin in the 'movie_data' database:

- ratings

## Summary
Extracting, Transforming and loading data can get pretty complicated!!!
